Snakes and Ladders is an ancient board, game regarded today as a worldwide classic. It originated in India as part of a family of dice board games such as parchisi. It was known as Moksha Patam and is played between two or more players on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of ladders and snakes are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one’s game piece, according to die rolls, from the start to the finish, helped or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively. The Snakes and Ladders in the game represente Vice and Virtue where karma is part of the journey to the end.

## Technology / Game Assets Used
Alphabet Match was developed in Unity 3D version 2019.3.14. Inserting Low Poly Assets into the environment graphics is less distracting than high-resolution graphics and keeps the focus on the gameplay. The Unity Asset Store was the source for all the (Free!) Game Assets used inside the game.
