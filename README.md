Adaptive learning, also known as adaptive teaching, is an educational method which uses computer algorithms to orchestrate the interaction with the learner and deliver customized resources and learning activities to address the unique needs of each learner.

## Technology / Game Assets Used
Alphabet Match was developed in Unity 3D version 2019.3.14. Inserting Low Poly Assets into the environment graphics is less distracting than high-resolution graphics and keeps the focus on the gameplay. The Unity Asset Store was the source for all the (Free!) Game Assets used inside the game.
