Hi Paul & Max,

Thanks for meeting with us today.  I'll try to send you all the data that you asked for by the end of the week.  I will have to reach out to the facility for the gender & age grouping, and languages spoken.  

I briefly looked over these and it looks like this has ALL the notes (that I have at least).  Besides from in Google I have all the notes hand written so if you have a question or want more inform honestly by looking at my own notes it jogs my memory so I may very well have an answer for you.  

7/29/19- We started later in the day at about 10:29am.  I know you asked about 7/31 if it was later in the day and that does also look like it was later in the day.
I had some family health issues going on in the summer so I did document days when something happened with that in case there was any mistakes on those days (for my own personal sanity) could see how I could make such a mistake.  I don't have anything documented for the second day of testing for 102 & 103 swapping- it honestly could have been just getting to know the children & we swapped the iPads that day.  

During testing I did also make notes of suggestions for the program:
Some way to show progress (like we spoke about today)
Some way to display different levels even if it's different background or different coloring.  
Centering the lowercase letter (I guess that seemed to not be in the center when I saw it and made that note).  

I sent you both the data information that we looked at today in the meeting.  I also sent you the "Experimental Data" notes.  

If you have any questions shoot me an email/text/smoke signal/whatever.  

Thanks so much for your time, your assistance, and cooperation for this project.
