title
character select
intro w/ difficulty hints
game
outtro party w/ medals

start of session, pick difficulty based on evaluation of previous sessions

difficulty
- three of goal letter
  - 'pass' is no mistakes and fast enough
- two of goal letter
- one of goal letter
- cloud obscures goal, clears with taps or time
  - 'pass' is when you select the letter before the cloud clears
- no goal visible, only audio

case
- upper
- upper, mixed
- upper, mixed, lower

segmented alphabet (windows of 5)



each letter has a difficulty (different cases are counted as different letters, including mixed)
letters are worked in segments


find 5-letter window with lowest average difficulty
work that segment (2-3 times through)
show interstitial animation (two characters passing an item, lani names them)
loop

pool starts with only upper case, then add other cases as average difficulty of previous case group gets above threshold



playing a letter changes its difficulty level by a weighted amount (different for right and wrong)
combo -- increases your 'right' change if you're not getting anything wrong
